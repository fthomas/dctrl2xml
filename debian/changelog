dctrl2xml (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added example XSL stylesheets for converting dctrl2xml's XML output to
    XHTML. Thanks to Antonio Ospite <ospite@studenti.unina.it> for providing
    those stylesheets.
  * Remove full stops from blank lines in the long description of a package.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added docbook-xml to Build-Depends to make docbook2x-man happy.
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2, no changes required.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't autogenerate debian/control at build-time with CDBS.
  * Updated postal address of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

dctrl2xml (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote parts of the Debian control parser and switched from xml.dom to
    the python-elementtree module for building the XML tree. This
    implementation is twice as fast as the old one with xml.dom.
  * Removed the -e / --encoding command line option, because it was only
    needed for the xml.dom module.
  * Added manual page for dctrl2xml.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added Build-Depends-Indep on docbook2x for building dctrl2xml's man page.
    - Removed python (>= 2.3) from Build-Depends-Indep. I don't even remember
      why I put it there in the first place. The (unversioned) dependency on
      python is needed for dh_python, which is used in CDBS'
      python-distutils class.
    - Added Depends on python-elementtree.
    - Finally wrote the extended description for this package. :-)
