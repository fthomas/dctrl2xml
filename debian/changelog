dctrl2xml (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/dctrl2xml.xml:
    - Fixed Lintian's "I: hyphen-used-as-minus-sign" by enclosing the command
      examples with the <userinput> element.
    - Updated from DocBook 4.2 to 4.4, which is the latest version in etch.
    - Enhanced the command synopsis and added to the description of the --file
      option that dctrl2xml can read plain text, gzip, bzip2 or ZIP files.
  * Updated the debhelper compatibility level from V5 to V6 since this is the
    current recommended level and raised the build dependency to "debhelper
    (>= 6)".
  * dctrl2xml: Improved parse_filelist() and added error handling to it.

dctrl2xml (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * dctrl2xml:
    - Do not fail on truncated tags where the "::" separator is missing.
    - Improved contacts parsing to handle strings such as "john@example.org
      (John R. Doe)".
    - Instead of replacing only "3" with "_3" in tags, prefix all tags that
      begin with a decimal digit with an underscore.
    - Added the "generator" attribute, whose value is "dctrl2xml/$VERSION", to
      the topmost element of dctrl2xml's XML output.
    - Parse also the file list of the Conffiles field.
    - Print error messages to standard error if the format of field data of
      several fields could not be recognized.
    - Do not fail if 'UTC' is used as time zone designator (as it is done in
      Release files), although RFC 2822 does not seem to permit this.
    - Do not discard the last (or the only) control entry if data input does
      not end with an empty line.
  * debian/rules: Added test target that stress tests dctrl2xml with the dpkg
    available file and the output of "apt-cache dumpavail".
  * debian/control: Moved python-support from Build-Depends to
    Build-Depends-Indep, because it is not required for the clean target.

dctrl2xml (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * dctrl2xml:
    - Print dctrl2xml's version number if the --version option is given.
    - Convert RFC 2822 dates in Date fields to a ISO 8601 representation and
      save them in <date_iso8601> elements.
    - Enabled Debtags parsing again, it was disabled in 0.7 due to errors
      when parsing "compressed tags". This has been corrected.
  * doc/dctrl2xml.xml: Added reference to deb-control(5) to the SEE ALSO
    section.
  * stylesheets/pkglist{,compact}.xsl: Reformatted and added example usage of
    dctrl2xml and the stylesheets with a Packages file.

dctrl2xml (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian. (closes: #456597)
  * dctrl2xml:
    - DebianControlParser.parse_package_string() has been very much simplified
      by using Deb822 from the debian_bundle.deb822 module. This requires a
      dependency on the python-debian package.
    - Do not parse the long description for upstream author or homepage. The
      Homepage field is a proper control field since dpkg 1.14.6 and the
      Author pseudo field in the long description is not widely used.
    - Added Breaks to the list of package relations.
    - Improved the parsing of the Description and Files fields.
    - Instead of reading entire files, read them line by line and dump the XML
      tree after an empty line occured. This improves dctrl2xml's performance
      and decreases it's memory usage.
  * doc/dctrl2xml.xml:
    - Added the DESCRIPTION section and updated the examples.
    - Removed &lt; and &gt; from email elements, because docbook2x-man adds
      those now itself.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3, no changes required.
    - Removed Homepage pseudo field from description, there is no homepage.
    - Added Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields to the source stanza.
    - Reworked the short description and enhanced the long description. Thanks
      to Justin B Rye <jbr@edlug.org.uk> for the review.
  * debian/rules: Do not ignore "make clean" errors.
  * Changed my email address to fst@debian.org.

dctrl2xml (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * scripts/dctrl2xml:
    - Now parses also debtags. Facets and tags are both elements and tags are
      always empty. Colons in tags are replaced with a hyphen.
    - Removed the second level <package> element which was a duplicate of
      the <name> element.
  * doc/dctrl2xml.xml: Added an example which pipes dctrl2xml's output to
    xmllint to reformat and reindent the XML to make it easier to read.
  * debian/control: Added homepage field to long description.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Thu,  1 Mar 2007 17:28:21 +0100

dctrl2xml (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * scripts/dctrl2xml: Use /usr/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/python2.3 as
    interpreter. However, 2.3 remains the minimum required Python version.
  * Updated packaging to the new Python policy using python-support.
  * Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.2 to 3.7.2, no changes required.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Sat, 23 Sep 2006 17:55:13 +0200

dctrl2xml (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added example XSL stylesheets for converting dctrl2xml's XML output to
    XHTML. Thanks to Antonio Ospite <ospite@studenti.unina.it> for providing
    these stylesheets.
  * Remove full stops from blank lines in the long description of a package.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added docbook-xml to Build-Depends to make docbook2x-man happy.
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2, no changes required.
  * debian/rules: Don't autogenerate debian/control at build-time with CDBS.
  * Updated postal address of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Sat, 10 Sep 2005 02:37:39 +0200

dctrl2xml (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote parts of the Debian control parser and switched from xml.dom to
    the python-elementtree module for building the XML tree. This
    implementation is twice as fast as the old one with xml.dom.
  * Removed the -e / --encoding command line option, because it was only
    needed for the xml.dom module.
  * Added manual page for dctrl2xml.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added Build-Depends-Indep on docbook2x for building dctrl2xml's man page.
    - Removed python (>= 2.3) from Build-Depends-Indep. I don't even remember
      why I put it there in the first place. The (unversioned) dependency on
      python is needed for dh_python, which is used in CDBS'
      python-distutils class.
    - Added Depends on python-elementtree.
    - Finally wrote the extended description for this package. :-)

dctrl2xml (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added command line option to specify the input's encoding.
  * Minor bugs fixed.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Thu, 13 Jan 2005 18:53:24 +0100

dctrl2xml (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
