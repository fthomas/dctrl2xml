dctrl2xml (0.3) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Rewrote parts of the Debian control parser and switched from xml.dom to
    the python-elementtree module for building the XML tree. This
    implementation is twice as fast as the old one with xml.dom. 
  * Removed the -e / --encoding command line option, because it was only
    needed for the xml.dom module.
  * Added manual page for dctrl2xml.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added Build-Depends-Indep on docbook2x for building dctrl2xml's man page.
    - Removed python (>= 2.3) from Build-Depends-Indep. I don't even remember
      why I put it there in the first place. The (unversioned) dependency on
      python is needed for dh_python, which is used in CDBS'
      python-distutils class.
    - Added Depends on python-elementtree.
    - Finally wrote the extended description for this package. :-)
